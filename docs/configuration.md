# Configuration file

Zalmoxis uses [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) to structure its configuration file. The default is `default.toml`.

All of the parameters required to run the model are listed below with short explanations of their purpose and the values they accept. Configuration files can contain blank lines. Comments are indicated with a `#` symbol. Whitespace indentation is purely stylistic.
