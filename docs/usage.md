# Usage

## Running Zalmoxis

You can directly run Zalmoxis using the command:

```console
python -m zalmoxis -c [cfgfile]
```

where `[cfgfile]` is typically the path to the default configuration file (typically `input/default.toml` from the base directory).

### Simulating Earth-like rocky exoplanets

To simulate a rocky exoplanet with Earth-like composition, configure the following parameters in the default configuration file:

```console
[AssumptionsAndInitialGuesses]
core_mass_fraction = 0.325     
mantle_mass_fraction = 0 
weight_iron_fraction = 0.325         

[EOS]
choice = "Tabulated:iron/silicate"
```

### Simulating Earth-like hot rocky exoplanets

To simulate a hot rocky exoplanet with Earth-like composition but a molten or partially molten mantle, configure the following parameters in the default configuration file:

```console
[AssumptionsAndInitialGuesses]
core_mass_fraction = 0.325     
mantle_mass_fraction = 0 
weight_iron_fraction = 0.325         
temperature_mode           = "isothermal" # Can be also "linear" or "prescribed"
surface_temperature        = 2000 # Required for temperature_mode="isothermal" or "linear"
center_temperature         = 3000 # Required for temperature_mode="linear"
temperature_profile_file   = "temp_profile.txt" # Filename containing a prescribed temperature profile; must be in the `input/` directory.

[EOS]
choice = "Tabulated:iron/Tdep_silicate"
```

This configuration models a fully differentiated two-layer planet consisting of a 32.5% iron core and a MgSiO3 mantle that can be solid, partially molten, or fully molten depending on local pressure and temperature. With this choice of EOS, the mantle is described by realistic phase transitions, in contrast to the 300â€¯K MgSiO3 EOS from [Seager et al. (2007)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/521346), which is a purely solid mantle.

*Note*: The input `temperature_profile_file` must contain one column with one temperature value per radial grid point. The number of values must match the number of layers (`num_layers`) in the model.

### Simulating water-rich exoplanets

To simulate a water-rich planet:

```console
[InputParameter]
core_mass_fraction = 0.065
mantle_mass_fraction = 0.485

[EOS]
choice = "Tabulated:water"
```

This configuration models a fully differentiated three-layer planet composed of a 6.5% iron core, a 48.5% silicate mantle, and a 45% outer water layer by mass.

## Running Zalmoxis in parallel for multiple masses

To run Zalmoxis over a range of planetary masses in parallel, you can use the `run_parallel.py` utility from the `src/tools/` directory using the command:

```console
python -m src.tools.run_parallel [choice]
```

where `[choice]` specifies the set of planetary masses to simulate. The available options are:

* `Wagner`: Simulates 7 rocky planets with masses of 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, and 15 Earth masses. This option is designed to reproduce the mass range explored in [Wagner et al., 2012](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2012/05/aa18441-11/aa18441-11.html). It is physically meaningful when the configuration is set to simulate Earth-like rocky exoplanets as described above.
* `Boujibar`: Simulates rocky planets with integer masses from 1 to 10 Earth masses, corresponding to the mass range used in [Boujibar et al., 2020](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020JGRE..12506124B/abstract). This is meaningful when using the Earth-like rocky planet configuration.
* `default`: Runs simulations for planets with masses from 1 to 10 Earth masses (inclusive), in unit steps. This serves as the fallback set if no specific option is provided. 
* `SeagerEarth`: Simulates Earth-like rocky planets with masses of 1, 5, 10, and 50 Earth masses, to replicate the models in [Seager et al., 2007](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/521346). Use this with the Earth-like rocky planet configuration.
* `Seagerwater`: Simulates water-rich planets with masses of 1, 5, 10, and 50 Earth masses. Use this with the water-rich planet configuration.
* `custom`: Simulates 50 planets with integer masses from 1 to 50 Earth masses, ideal for generating high-resolution mass-radius curves or broader parametric sweeps.
