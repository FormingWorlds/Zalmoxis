# Usage

## Running Zalmoxis

You can directly run Zalmoxis using the command:

```console
python -m zalmoxis -c [cfgfile]
```

where `[cfgfile]` is typically the path to the default configuration file (`default.toml`).
A data folder containing reference data (see [Data](https://zalmoxis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data/)) is automatically downloaded and extracted when Zalmoxis is run with this command.
