# Reference Data

## Mass-radius relations

The following curves serve as reference benchmarks for validating the Zalmoxis internal structure model under both rocky and water-rich configurations:

* Earth-like rocky exoplanets, with a 32.5% Fe + 67.5% MgSiO3 composition, taken from [Zeng et al., 2019](https://lweb.cfa.harvard.edu/~lzeng/planetmodels.html). 

* Water exoplanets, with a 50% Earth-like rocky core (32.5% Fe + 67.5% MgSiO3) and 50% water by mass at 300â€¯K and surface pressure of 1 millibar. 

## Seager EOS data

[Seager et al. (2007)](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/521346) provide density-pressure EOS data for planetary materials:
